# PAL Tool

A powerful command-line tool for managing GitHub pull requests and branch reconciliation workflows.

## Features

- Create multiple pull requests across different target branches with a single command
- Automated branch reconciliation process
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- GitHub CLI integration

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 24.04)
- Git
- GitHub CLI (gh)

## Installation

1. Install Git (if not already installed):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

2. Install GitHub CLI:
```bash
# Add GitHub CLI repository
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null

# Update package list and install GitHub CLI
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

3. Authenticate with GitHub:
```bash
gh auth login
```
Follow the interactive prompts to complete the authentication process.

4. Clone and set up the tool:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd pal-tool
chmod +x pal-tool.sh
```

5. Create a bash alias (optional but recommended):
```bash
# Add this line to your ~/.bashrc file
echo 'alias pal-tool="$(pwd)/pal-tool.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload your bash configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can use the `pal-tool` command from any directory!

## Usage

The tool provides three main commands:

### 1. Create Pull Requests

Creates pull requests from a source branch to multiple target branches (test, stage, and build_branch).

```bash
pal-tool create-prs <source_branch> [pr_title]
```

Example:
```bash
pal-tool create-prs feature-branch "My PR Title"
```

### 2. Branch Reconciliation

Creates a reconciliation branch and merges changes from a source branch into it.

```bash
pal-tool recon <branch_name> <base_branch>
```

Example:
```bash
pal-tool recon feature-branch main
```

### 3. Help

Display help information:

```bash
pal-tool help
# or
pal-tool -h
# or
pal-tool --help
```

## How It Works

### Create PRs Command
- Takes a source branch and optional PR title as input
- Creates PRs to test, stage, and build_branch environments
- Automatically formats PR titles with branch information
- Uses GitHub CLI for PR creation

### Reconciliation Command
- Creates a new branch named `<branch_name>_rec_<base_branch>`
- Merges changes from the source branch into the reconciliation branch
- Handles existing reconciliation branches
- Includes error handling and rollback capabilities

## Error Handling

The tool includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validates required parameters
- Checks Git operations success
- Provides clear error messages
- Automatically rolls back to original branch on failure
